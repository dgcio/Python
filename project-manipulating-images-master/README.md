# Assignment Instructions

You'll get the chance to do some fun things with images in this project. Before starting, making sure you've:
1. Read the chapter about manipulating images, and
2. Have followed the instructions in Appendix A of the textbook for installing `pillow`

The best thing to do with this project is to follow along in the section titled `Project: Adding a Logo`. Eveything will be the same, with the exception that you'll use a different logo image (as provided in this root directory of this repository) and that you'll add the logo to a series of images (provided in the `originals` directory of this repository).

# How to Acquire Project Files

1. To start, [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) this repository.
2. [Clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone) your forked repository to your computer.
3. Modify the files and, when you're ready to submit, [commit](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes) changes to complete your solution.
4. Push/sync the changes up to GitHub.
5. [Create a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
