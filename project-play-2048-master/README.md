# Assignment Instructions

You'll use what you've learned in the Web Scraping chapter to write a program that plays a game of 2048 on its own. Before you start, make sure you've:
1. Read the chapter on Web Scraping
2. Have followed the instructions in Appendix A of the textbook for installing Selenium
As with previous assignments, when you look through the code that's provided, you'll find any lines marked with `TO DO` as a call for you to do something.

# Description of Project Files
* **.travis.yml**: do not edit this file, it is used for automated testing
* **play2048-runner.py**: this file sets up the program to run for 100 iterations. You don't need to edit this file but you can take a peek, if you'd like. If you do edit, edit at your own risk!
* **play2048.py**: you'll need to edit this file, it contains one empty function, and some comments that start with `#TODO` that will detail what you need to do for full credit.
* **test_play2048.py**: do not edit this file, it is used for automated testing
